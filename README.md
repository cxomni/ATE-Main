# ATE-Main

This repository is based on MIT-License and develops on the idea of LCF-ATEPC model produced by yangheng95(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07976.pdf). The model has two components namely-
1. ATE (Aspect Term Extraction)
2. ABSA (Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis)

Both of the above models use BERT( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) as the focus of their design, but develop in very different directions. At the very last, we shall try to save the model and use the model for making the predictions.

## Note
This model would act as final stationary model and we shall track the changes made by the CX-Manager and their corrections are recorde, which shall later be combined for training once again.
